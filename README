Temple for generic document written in LaTeX using amsart class. The LaTeX macros and bibliography are stored in files vit-prusa.bib and vit-prusa-macros-experimental.tex. These files are SYMLINKS to ../bibliography-and-macros/vit-prusa.bib and ../bibliography-and-macros/vit-prusa-macros-experimental.tex, which means that the template works properly only if you alos clone the repository bibliography-and-macros to the same directory as the template.
